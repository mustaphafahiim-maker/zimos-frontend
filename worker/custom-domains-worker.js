/**
 * Cloudflare Worker in front of merchant custom domains (Cloudflare for SaaS).
 *
 * A shopper opens https://www.merchant-shop.com/products/x. That hostname is a
 * custom hostname on our zone, so Cloudflare terminates TLS with its own
 * certificate and runs this Worker. Railway only answers hosts registered on
 * the storefront service, so the Worker calls the storefront's own Railway
 * host (ORIGIN_HOST) and says which host the shopper asked for:
 *
 *   X-Zimos-Host       the shopper's host (www.merchant-shop.com)
 *   X-Forwarded-Host   the same, for a storefront from before X-Zimos-Host
 *   X-Forwarded-Proto  https
 *   X-Zimos-Edge       EDGE_SECRET, the proof that this Worker sent it; the
 *                      storefront (apps/storefront/src/lib/edgeHost.ts)
 *                      ignores X-Zimos-Host without it
 *   X-Zimos-Client-IP  the shopper's IP (CF-Connecting-IP)
 *
 * The host goes in a header of our own because Railway's edge sets
 * X-Forwarded-Host itself, to the host it was called on (ORIGIN_HOST), so the
 * value sent here never reaches the storefront under that name.
 *
 * Secrets (wrangler secret put / dashboard > Settings > Variables):
 *   ORIGIN_HOST  e.g. storefront-production.up.railway.app (no scheme)
 *   EDGE_SECRET  the same value as the storefront's CUSTOM_DOMAIN_EDGE_SECRET
 *
 * Setup steps: docs/custom-domains/README.md. Nothing here is deployed by the
 * repository.
