 * Worker calls our own Railway host, so `Host` is ours and the visitor's host
 * is in `X-Zimos-Host`. Not `X-Forwarded-Host`: Railway's edge sets that one
 * itself, to the host it was called on (ours), whatever the Worker sent. A
 * Worker from before X-Zimos-Host sent only X-Forwarded-Host, which is still
 * read when X-Zimos-Host is absent. The Worker proves it
 * is the Worker with `X-Zimos-Edge`, equal to CUSTOM_DOMAIN_EDGE_SECRET.
 * Without that proof the forwarded host is ignored: anyone can call the
 * origin directly and send any header they like.
