 * A page tree rendered by the storefront itself, unsaved edits included.

 * checks the merchant's session against the API, keeps the tree briefly and
 * redirects the frame to a page that renders it with the live components.
 *
 * Re-posts shortly after the tree stops changing. The token is minted here, so
 * every refresh reuses one preview slot instead of piling up new ones.
 *
 * Two frames take turns: each new render loads into the hidden one and is
 * swapped in once it has loaded, so an edit never blanks the page in between.
 *
 * A change patches the page; it does not reload it. With a canvas, a change
 * that only touches an element's text, picture, visibility or a few simple
 * style values (lib/previewBridge.ts `diffTreePatch`) is posted to the
 * showing frame at once as `zimos:patch`, and the render waits for 1.5s of
 * quiet instead of 0.7s (0.3s with an imported template's tools). Anything
 * else renders as it always did.
 *
 * The device frame: phone (390), tablet (768) or desktop (1280). With `fit`
 * the frame is laid out at that true width and scaled down to fit the stage,
 * so "desktop" really is the desktop layout however narrow the pane; the
 * phone gets a soft bezel. Without `fit` nothing changes from before.
